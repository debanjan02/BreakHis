# BreakHis
The Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification (BreakHis) is  composed of 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients using different magnifying factors (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X).  To date, it contains 2,480  benign and 5,429 malignant samples (700X460 pixels, 3-channel RGB, 8-bit depth in each channel, PNG format). This database has been built in collaboration with the P&D Laboratory  â€“ Pathological Anatomy and Cytopathology, Parana, Brazil.
The benign breast tissues can be classified into 4 classes adenosis, fibroadenoma, plyllodes tumor, tubular adenoma and the malignant tissues can be classified into ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, papillary carcinoma.
The aim is to classify all the images into right class and improve prediction accuracy
